There are three types of server rendering patterns:
1. Static rendering
2. Dynamic rendering
3. HTML Streaming


Static Rendering:
In Static Rendering the page is pre-rendered and delivered to the client with minimal code. 
For server component: RSC Payload is generated and sent to the client where react takes over and renders the page.
For client components: RSC Payload is generated along with instructions to the client side, that includes the references to the javascript chunks.
After the application is built, it acts as static rendering.
On static rendering the routes along with js chunks and RSC payload are downloaded and pre-fetched, which means it is a concept in which next.js downloads or loads the route when it is users' viewport.
For static routes, they are pre-fetched and cached by default.

For hydration, JS IS ALSO FETCHED.(WHICH IS THAT CHUNK FOR CLIENT)
STATIC RENDERING IS GREAT FOR PERFORMANCE SEO, BLOGGING, DOCUMENTATION AND MARKETING PAGES.

in static rendering the output is present in .next folder, which is the build folder.



Dynamic Rendering:
In Dynamic Rendering, it is useful the data is personalized to user or information when it useful only during the request time
E-commerce apps, user dashboards, social feed etc.
During rendering if any dynamic function is discovered such as: cookies(), searchParams, headers() etc. then Next.js switches that route to dynamic rendering.
Example:(this is dynamically generated)
function Dashboard() {
    const cookieStore= cookies();
    const { user } = useAuth();
    return <h1>Welcome {user.name}</h1>
}
For dynamic rendering, the output is not present in that folder though.


Streaming:
In Streaming, the server sends the response in chunks to the client.
There are three components in a page
1. Header
2. Product Details: will take 3 sec
3. Product Reviews: will take  4 sec

If streaming is not used, entire page will load in 4 se
if streaming is used, header is sent first, then product details are fetched by wrapping in suspense boundary and then product reviews in an another suspense boundary.
